        How We Communicate Without Words

        <p>
          Human awareness existed long before spoken language. The body
          continuously communicates through posture, breath rhythm, stillness,
          tension, and responsiveness.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sessions at Happiness X are guided primarily through attention to
          these non-verbal cues rather than verbal instruction or explanation.
          This allows clients to engage without needing to analyse or articulate
          their experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          The practitioner does not interpret sensations or impose meaning.
          Instead, the session environment is adjusted to support the client’s
          own internal capacity for regulation, relaxation, and awareness.
