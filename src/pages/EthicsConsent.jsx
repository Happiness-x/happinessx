        <p>
          Happiness X operates on principles of informed consent,
          professional ethics, and client autonomy. Participation in any
          session is voluntary and based on clear understanding of the
          service scope.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl text-cyan-300">Autonomy & Choice</h2>
        <p>
          Clients remain in control of their participation at all times.
          There is no obligation to continue, respond, or engage beyond
          personal comfort.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl text-cyan-300">Professional Boundaries</h2>
        <p>
          Sessions are non-invasive, non-sexual, and conducted without
          physical contact. No interpretation of sensations or emotional
          responses is imposed.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl text-cyan-300">Trauma-Informed Approach</h2>
        <p>
          The practice prioritises psychological safety, pacing, and
          respect for individual boundaries. Clients are encouraged to
          seek licensed care when appropriate.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl text-cyan-300">Consent Statement</h2>
        <p>
          By booking or participating in a session, clients acknowledge
          understanding of the nature, scope, and limitations of the
          service.
