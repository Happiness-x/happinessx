          </h3>
          <p>

            These sessions focus on relaxation, bodily awareness, emotional
            grounding, and nervous system regulation. They are not medical,
            psychological, or therapeutic treatment.

            Is this therapy, medicine, or mental health care?
          </h3>
          <p>
            No. Services provided by Happiness X do not diagnose, treat, cure,
            or prevent any medical or psychological condition and are not a
            substitute for licensed healthcare or psychotherapy.

            How does this relate to Ayurveda or traditional wisdom?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Traditional systems such as Ayurveda emphasise the relationship
            between awareness, balance, and regulation of the body–mind system.
            This practice draws inspiration from those principles without
            applying medical models, diagnoses, or prescriptive treatment.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-3">
            The emphasis is on awareness and observation rather than correction
            or intervention.

            How can sessions work effectively online or at a distance?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Sessions do not rely on physical contact or energy transmission.
            Human nervous systems communicate continuously through non-verbal
            signals such as breathing patterns, posture, pacing, stillness,
            and responsiveness.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-3">
            By attending to these cues and adjusting guidance accordingly,
            sessions support the client’s own capacity for relaxation and
            self-regulation—regardless of physical distance.

            Is there any form of telepathy, energy transfer, or suggestion?
          </h3>
          <p>
            No. Sessions do not involve telepathic communication, energy
            transmission, suggestion, hypnosis, or interpretation of internal
            experiences. Any sensations or responses experienced are generated
            internally by the client’s own physiological and psychological
            processes.

            What if I don’t know how to describe what I feel?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Verbal explanation is not required. Sessions are designed so that
            clients do not need to analyse, describe, or explain their
            experience. Awareness is allowed to unfold without pressure.

            Are sessions physical or hands-on?
          </h3>
          <p>
            No. All sessions are conducted online and are non-invasive.
            There is no physical contact.

            Who may benefit from this type of session?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Sessions may be suitable for individuals seeking relaxation,
            awareness-based wellness support, and a gentle, non-directive
            approach to self-regulation.

            When might this not be appropriate?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Individuals experiencing acute psychological distress, unmanaged
            medical conditions, or trauma-related symptoms are advised to seek
            appropriate licensed medical or mental health care before or
            alongside engaging in complementary wellness practices.

          <p>
            Yes. Participation is entirely voluntary and client-led. You may
            pause or discontinue a session at any time without explanation.
